# SQL To-Do-List

## Description
Duration: Weekend Project

The goal of this project was to create a full-stack CRUD app that allows user to create Tasks for a to-do-list. The Tasks created from client are sent to server to be stored in the local database. The Tasks can be marked as 'Complete' or 'Delete', which will be updated in the database. Additional feature include popups that confirms action of users.
